# JS 30 days challenges

- Course videos:  https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5bdbdfda360a652eedd97863
- Course starter files: https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30

## Guideline

The whole idea of this challenge is to:
- Watch each of the video each day except Friday
- Build on what you learn (if no idea, just use the INDEX-start.html that is in the starter_file for each day.
- Write down a memo
- Meet together every evening around 9pm and discuss.
